About the Granger Causality tests:\n","\n","The Pvalues we get from running the Granger Causality Test (parameter Ftest, SSR based chi2 test, SSR based Ftest, Likelihood Ratio test) on our stock data is largely similar\n","\n","chi2: chi squared statistic tells you how much difference exists between your observed counts and the counts you would expect if there was no relationship at all in the population.\n","\n","SSR: Regression Sum of Squares.\n","\n","We say that a variable X ***Granger-causes*** another evolving variable Y if the predictions of the value of Y based on its own past values ***and*** on the past values of X are better than predictions of Y based only on Y's own past values. \n","\n","* About the Partial Autocorrelation comparison:\n","\n","In time series analysis,
